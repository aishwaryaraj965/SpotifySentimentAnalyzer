(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lay there
Back of my mind, he stay there
Pops up time to time like, ""Hey there""
Haven't seen you in two years, but, baby, we still breathe the same air
New love and it's almost workin'
And I never used to be this person
But here I am
Hands on my chest and my knees on the carpet
Hopin' you'll stop it (Ah)

[Chorus]
Dear God
Take his kiss right out of my brain
Take the pleasure out of my pain
Take the way he used to say, ""I love you""
Dear God
Get his imprint out of my bed
Take ""amazing"" out of our sex
Take away the way I still might want to

[Post-Chorus]
Facts
All the memories, babe, I play 'em all, play 'em all, play 'em all, play 'em all back
To erase his name, I'd give it all, give it all, give everything that I have
All my no-good thoughts, I pray about, pray about, pray about, pray about that
Take away the way I still might want to

[Verse 2]
Hottest
Thing I've ever touched, just bein' honest
Really tryna be good, I promise
That's why I'm here
With my hands on my chest and my knees on the carpet
Hopin' you'll stop it (Ah)

[Chorus]
Dear God
Take his kiss right out of my brain
Take the pleasure out of my pain
Take the way he used to say, ""I love you""

Houston,Still Woozy,"[Verse 1]
You had just left your home
Still pink out on your own
When you were struck down low
Tried too hard to fit in
Were never one of them
Started to forget the real you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you to say
That you'll get right
I don't need a lie tonight
Might not be your fault
But it's not mine
Please just fall in line

Make you better
Make you right
I'd wave my hand and
You'd be alright
A little too late
For that, it's true
But I won't give up on you

You called me yesterday
What were you tryna say
Sounded so scrambled and frantic
More than a couple years
Since I could hear you clear
Starting to forget the old you

I don't want you to say
That you'll get right
I don't need a lie tonight
Might not be your fault
But it's not mine
Maybe I'll stop tryin'

You promised a lifetime but left in a moment
I wonder if you even think about me
Throw me a lifeline 'cause I'm barely floating
Stranded and broken

Achilles Come Down,Gang of Youths,"[Verse 1]
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
You're scaring us and all of us, some of us love you
Achilles, it's not much but there's proof
You crazy-ass cosmonaut, remember your virtue
Redemption lies plainly in truth
Just humour us, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won’t you get up off, get up off the roof?
[Sample]
Je vois que beaucoup de gens meurent, parce qu'ils estiment que la vie ne vaut pas la peine d'être vécue. J'en vois d'autres, qui se font paradoxalement tuer pour des idées, pour des illusions, qui leurs donnent une raison de vivre (ce, qu'on appelle une raison de vivre est en même temps une excellente raison de mourir)

[Verse 2]
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
The self is not so weightless, nor whole and unbroken
Remember the pact of our youth
Where you go, I'm going, so jump and I'm jumping
Since there is no me without you
Soldier on, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?

[Pre-Chorus]
Loathe the way they light candles in Rome
But love the sweet air of the votives
Hurt and grieve but don’t suffer alone
Engage with the pain as a motive

Today, of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you’ll rise above

D'un gérant d'immeuble qui s'était tué on disait un jour qu'il avait perdu sa fille depuis cinq ans, qu'il avait beaucoup changé depuis et que cette histoire l'avait-
[Verse 3]
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, jump now
You are absent of cause or excuse
So self-indulgent and self-referential
No audience could ever want you
You crave the applause yet hate the attention
Then miss it, your act is a ruse
It is empty, Achilles, so end it all now
It's a pointless resistance for you
[Sample]
Ce qui déclenche la crise est presque toujours incontrôlable. Les journaux parlent souvent de « chagrins intimes » ou de « maladie incurable ». Ces explications sont valables, mais il faudrait savoir si le jour même un ami du désespéré ne lui a pas parlé sur un ton indifférent. Celui‑là est le-

[Verse 4]
Achilles, Achilles, just put down the bottle
Don't listen to what you've consumed
It’s chaos, confusion and wholly unworthy
Of feeding and it's wholly untrue
You may feel no purpose nor a point for existing
It's all just conjecture and gloom
And there may not be meaning, so find one and seize it
Do not waste yourself on this roof

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear those bells ring deep in the soul
Chiming away for a moment
Feel your breath course frankly below
And see life as a worthy opponent
[Chorus]
Today, of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you’ll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it’s more courageous to overcome

You want the acclaim, the mother of mothers
(It's not worth it, Achilles)
More poignant than fame or the taste of another

But be real and just jump, you dense motherfucker

You will not be more than a rat in the gutter
(So much more than a rat)
You want my opinion, my opinion you’ve got
(No one asked your opinion)
You asked for my counsel, I gave you my thoughts
(No one asked for your thoughts)
Be done with this now and jump off the roof
(Be done with this now and get off the roof)
Can you hear me, Achilles? I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Achilles, come down
Achilles, come down

[Sample]
Celle du oui et celle du non. Ce serait trop beau. Mais il faut faire la part de ceux qui, sans conclure, interrogent toujours. Ici, j'ironise à peine : il s'agit de la majorité. Je vois également que ceux qui répondent non agissent comme s'ils pensaient oui. De fait-

Throw yourself into the unknown
With pace and a fury defiant
Clothe yourself in beauty untold
And see life as a means to a triumph

I missed your twenty-first birthday, I've been up at home
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half-drunk happy
Hate to think you went out without me
I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you, I would
Thought you'd see it comin', but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me

Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under

I'll be the love of your life inside your head

So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room

Would it make us look crazy?

Did you already know him? It's coincidental
That he knows your body and mind the way I do
The secrets you told me, were they confidential?
Or do you let anyone inside your mental?
I bet you ain't told him the things that we been through
I know you're not flossin' your wrist like you been doin'
The fact that I actually started to trust you
Then you broke my heart, someonе bring me a tissue
Or maybe my notеbook, I'll sharpen my pencil
To write you a letter and show you I'm into you (Show it)
Still down forever, even if it's pleasure
Go ahead, sign your name on the package I sent to you (Open)
You'll open it up and when you get to cheesin'
I hope you believe in the end that I got you (Got you)
How can I move forward if every relationship
I get in, don't hit the same if it ain’t you?

So please don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Don't fall in love with me

Do you still use that Versace bag that I bought you?
Look back at the pics of vacations I brought you on?
He can't even match it, he's not in my bracket
You settle for less with him, with me, I put you on
It doesn't look good on you, way too appealin'
To go through experiences that he's givin' you
'Cause you see on this side, I'll drape you in fire
Got bundles of roses lined up to the ceiling
I'm so good without you, I know that I'm healin' (Healin')
But that doesn't change that the way I've been feelin' (Feelin')
Is clouding my judgment, I act like it's nothin' (Nothin')
But really I suffer, I'm way too forgivin' (Sufferin')
Saw your new man and he looks like a joke
It's been a while since the both of us spoke
I can't help but think that my life would be better
If we never met, but that's not how it goes

From halfway down
Just promise me that it won't be slow

There were times
My soul felt broken
And there were times
My faith was shaken
Someway, somehow
We made it
Loved ones all around
Say it's just the beginning (Hey)

[Verse 1: Sri Sriram]
Staring at the rain real hard, praying for a hint of the summer
Feeling all the pain real hard, moving with a chip on my shoulder
Looking at the hate in the world, feeling lost in the world weighing me down
Reaching for a light too far, feeling like I was gonna drown

No longer guilt ridden by the silk and linen
Never condemn it, never condescending
Before you hear something, this dope again and people love it
You'll see the pope on the beach in Nantucket play the trumpet
Somehow, someway, we just made it out the filth and garbage
Where people kill for nonsense, world of sin, we need to be born again
From the problems of harlequins and the charlatans
Tryna stick their thorns in them, but they can't kill the confidence
This ain't religious, but yo, I see the crescent
See the illuminating cross in the sky in the distance
Or maybe it's just the clouds, how they shaping my vision
Telling me ""Never play down,"" my true existence
Forget what you know, just take a leap
No matter how high up you are, or how deep
Or what height it is, be the mightiest
We been in a tight spot, fight to live

Get ‘em up, banging dangerous as angel dust
Cuban Linx smokin' stink in the Brink’s trunk
I run with killas who snort powder, extort cowards
Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers
I give a fuck what you talking ’bout
Mob meetings, we them only niggas walking out
Sparkin' purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurpin'
Fly away in my new, Scaglietti surfin'

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches
Army coats on, playing the benches
Getting paper, sly, that’s the motto
Intelligent goons inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow

Army coats on, playing the benches
Getting paper, sly, that’s the motto
Intelligent goons inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows, bottles of Krug
The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude
Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty-eights
With bald-heads, all live wires
Eleven homes, six trust funds
Came home from doing a dime, we just left Un’s, straight up
And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaurds
Brought a Dairy Queen to Queens right next to Lowes
IMAX Theatres, Astoria Waldorf
Philip Drummond suite, pretty young thing suckin' my balls off
Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key-lime pie Wallo's
And I still got a half a ki indeed
Frank Lucas shit, hid it in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my knight
I’ma make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big lofts
Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killing like Orca
Daytime hawker, a nasty street author
Me, Rae and Rick, uzi’d out in the porches
Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal
I’ma Falcon, Seven Mike Vick with the ball
'Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect, I hunt you down
Ain’t a muthafuckin' crew we can’t run through

Whisper to me every time I close my eyes
He say, ""You deserve it all""
Keep these bitch niggas away from me
Keep all my blessings faithfully
Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me
I burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me
I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me
I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see
More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me
Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me
Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?
How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak
On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me

When my head's lost in the clouds

You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see the ring on your hand (Hand)

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?

Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
